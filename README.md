# Digital-Thermomister

This projects is created to check temperatures via a NTC Thermistor.
Project idea; Put this in any beverage/food and set the temperature via external buttons to get the perfect temperature before drinking or eating.

This prototype helps prevent heat burns from hot objects, and notifies you via LED when the beverage/food is ready to consume.
